			<p style="color: rgb(4, 166, 181);">Earth, our home, is the third planet from the <a href="">sun</a>. While scientists continue to hunt for
				clues of life beyond Earth, our home planet remains the only place in the universe where we've ever
				identified living organisms. </p>
			<p class="blueparagraph">Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas
				giants —
				<mark>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune </mark>— but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury,
				Mars and <span class="venus">Venus</span>.
			</p>
			<p class="yellowbold">Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) and is mostly round because <a
					href="">gravity</a> generally pulls matter into a ball. But the spin of our home planet causes it to be
				squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator, making the true shape of the Earth an "oblate spheroid."

		<p>Our planet is unique for many reasons, but its available water and oxygen are two defining features. Water
			covers roughly 71% of Earth's surface, with most of that water located in our planet's oceans. About a fifth of
			Earth's atmosphere consists of oxygen, produced by plants. </p>

		<h2 class="orbit-title">PLANET EARTH'S ORBIT AROUND THE SUN</h2>
		<div class="orbit-about">
			<p id="violettext">While Earth orbits the sun, the planet is simultaneously spinning around an imaginary line
				called an axis
				that runs through the core, from the North Pole to the South Pole. It takes Earth 23.934 hours to complete a
				rotation on its axis and 365.26 days to complete an orbit around the sun — our days and years on Earth are
				defined by these gyrations.</p>
			<p class="blueparagraph">Earth's axis of rotation is tilted in relation to the ecliptic plane, an imaginary
				surface through the
				planet's orbit around the sun. This means the Northern and Southern hemispheres will sometimes point toward
				or away from the sun depending on the time of year, and this changes the amount of light the hemispheres
				receive, resulting in the changing seasons.</p>
			<p class="yellowbold">Earth happens to orbit the sun within the so-called "Goldilocks zone," where temperatures are just right to
				maintain liquid water on our planet's surface. Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, but rather a slightly
				oval-shaped ellipse, similar to the orbits of all the other planets in our solar system. Our planet is a bit
				closer to the sun in early January and farther away in July, although this proximity has a much smaller
				effect on the temperatures we experience on the planet's surface than does the tilt of Earth's axis. </p>
			<p>Statistics about Earth's orbit, according to <a href="">NASA:</a></p>
			<ul class="statistics">
				<li class="statistics-list">Average distance from the sun: 92,956,050 miles (149,598,262 km)</li>
				<li class="statistics-list">Perihelion (closest approach to the sun): 91,402,640 miles (147,098,291 km)</li>
				<li class="statistics-list">Aphelion (farthest distance from the sun): 94,509,460 miles (152,098,233 km)
				</li>
				<li class="statistics-list">Length of solar day (single rotation on its axis): 23.934 hours</li>
				<li class="statistics-list">Length of year (single revolution around the sun): 365.26 days</li>
				<li class="statistics-list">Equatorial inclination to orbit: 23.4393 degrees</li>

		<h2 class="formation-title">EARTH'S FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
		<div class="formation-about">
			<p class="yellowbold">Scientists think Earth was formed at roughly the same time as the sun and other planets some 4.6 billion
				years ago when the solar system coalesced from a giant, rotating cloud of gas and dust known as the solar
				nebula. As the nebula collapsed under the force of its own gravity, it spun faster and flattened into a
				disk. Most of the material in that disk was then pulled toward the center to form the sun.</p>
			<p class="blueparagraph">
				Other particles within the disk collided and stuck together to form ever-larger bodies, including Earth.
				Scientists think Earth started off as a waterless mass of rock.
			</p>
			<p style="color: coral;">"It was thought that because of these asteroids and comets flying around colliding with Earth, conditions on
				early Earth may have been hellish," Simone Marchi, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute
				in Boulder, Colorado, previously told Space.com. </p>
			<p class="yellowbold">However, analyses of minerals trapped within ancient microscopic crystals suggest that there was liquid
				water already present on Earth during its first 500 million years, Marchi said.</p>
